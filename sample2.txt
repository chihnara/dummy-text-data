The saying goes that good things come in small packages, but so too do tiny, deadly amphibians. New research published in the journal PLOS ONE recovered one such zoological parcel in the south Mantiqueira mountain range of São Paulo, Brazil. The magnificently orange death-nugget hails from the genus Brachycephalus, a group that has experienced some taxonomical difficulties owing to the fact that its members are morphologically and genetically quite hard to tell apart.

The newest member had historically been lumped in with the pumpkin toadlet species Brachycephalus ephippium that’s found in São Paulo. However, when a particularly orange frog with a head rounder than it is long and an unfamiliar song came onto the scene, local biologists grew suspicious.

Pumpkin toadlets are named for their impressive orange coloration, though their resemblance to the large squash ends here, being themselves just the size of a thumbnail. The poisonous frogs all look quite similar and exhibit few genetic variations, making it all the more understandable that unique species can go unnoticed to science for quite some time.
